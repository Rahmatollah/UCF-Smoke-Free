UCF-Smoke-Free
==============

An agent-based model for simulating smoking behaviors of UCF students

This project models smoking behaviors of students at University of Central Florida (UCF) main campus, from Fall 2011 to Fall 2012. UCF launched its smoke-free campus initiative on Fall 2012. http://smokefree.sdes.ucf.edu/

The model works based on a normative architecture that is specifically designed for modeling smoking behaviors. More details about this architecture can be found in this paper: http://ial.eecs.ucf.edu/pdf/Sukthankar-Rahmatollah-AAMAS2014.pdf

Agents in this model are students of UCF. After starting the model, agents move around the campus according to a survey data about their transportation patterns. Three categories of features are defined for the agents. These features are meant to simulate how smoking norms alters among students.
